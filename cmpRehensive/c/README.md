# cmpRehenCve Description  
cmpRehenCve ("Comprehensive/Comprehen-C-ve") is designed to read a file (currently hardcoded as being in colocated with the cmp's .exe file, labeled 'manifest') of local (i.e., on-disk) file URLs into an array. After which, the program will examine each file's entry on the disk and compare that size with that of every other file located in the manifest file. Upon finding two identically-sized entries, program will compare files byte by byte to determine if they are identical or not.

Inspiration: the logical conclusion of "which language would baseline run the fastest on a Windows machine to do memory comparisons?" Also an excuse to improve C/probe into C++ if it comes to that.  
  
Currently in 1.0; unit tests complete. Manual data comparison (byte by byte) providing considerable time returns. Python's average iterations of ~25 minutes each are condensed to an average of 90 seconds (~1:17 runtime compression) here, although it's inconsistent. 

## Current State  
Program finished 1.0 test battery on 03/29/2023.  
__Battery__: Run on the image backup root directory of parents' computer: 27,000 files, poorly maintained/tracked, all compared against each other on hardware that is 10 years obsolete.  
__Results__: Runtime of just under 19 hours, with over 5,000 files detected as duplicates, leading to a recovery of 20 GB backup storage space.  
  
## Improvement Ideas  
1) Multithreading. Haven't done multithreading in C in a while, and it might be enough of an excuse to port to C++; in any case, most obvious direct improvement to runtime will be multithreading

2) Parameterization. Now that the program's been brought to a (demonstrative) working format, can change programmatic statements to functions/definitions, in order to parameterize/condense/clean up code flow. This is a proof of concept; still refining.
